# Collaborative-Sensing
UT Senior Design 2018
The goal of this project was to design and implement a resource-constrained system for collaborative sensing where two units interactively exchange data in order to track an object in occluded environments. Collaborative sensing leverages communication between sensors to improve each sensorâ€™s knowledge about the environment. Applications include self-driving vehicles and mobile robots that would require situational awareness.
